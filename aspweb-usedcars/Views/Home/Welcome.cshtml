    Solve the same problem you got for the PHP lab, but using the ASP.NET technology.
    In addition to the specification for the PHP lab, your application must implement user authentication
    and ask the user to authenticate himself/herself prior to actually using the web application (based on an username and password saved in the database).

    <br><br>
    <strong>The problem:</strong>
    <br>
    Write a web application for managing a second-hand car business. The application should maintain various information
    about a car in the database (i.e. model, engine power, fuel, price, color, age, history etc.). The application should
    implement: car browsing (use AJAX for retrieving cars from a specific category), adding, removing and updating a car.
    Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. category), should be displayed (do
    this in javascript).
